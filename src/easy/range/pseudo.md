# Pseudo Code Solution
Declare two variables, min and max, giving the first element in the array as their initial value.
Loop through the array. 
If the element is smaller then min, assign that value to min.
Otherwise, if it is larger than max, assign its value to max.
Calculate the difference after the loop has finished.
