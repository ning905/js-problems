# Plain English Solution
Use Math.random(), which can generate a random number between 0(inclusively) and 1(exclusively).
We can modify the range by giving the function two parameters, minNum and maxNum.
Generating random numbers with the range of the differences between the minNum and maxNum.
Then add minNum to the range.
The result will be a random number between minNum(inclusively) and maxNum(exclusively).

If needed, can also use Math.floor() to include the maxNum within the finally range.
